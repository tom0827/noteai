- **Introduction to Seismic Intensity Scale**
  - Describes the strength of ground shaking from seismic waves.
  - Intensity relates to earthquake effects at specific locations, while magnitude describes the earthquake itself.
  - Single earthquake can cause different intensities at different locations; usually greater near epicenter (attenuation).

- **Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale (MMI)**
  - Developed by Guiseppe Mercalli in 1902 and modified in 1931.
  - Uses Roman numerals to express perceived shaking levels.
    - MMI 1: Instrumental (not perceived by people).
    - MMI 3: Slight shaking (noticed but not recognized as an earthquake).
    - MMI 5: Rather strong (windows may break).
    - MMI 7: Very strong (difficult to stand).
    - MMI 9: Violent (some buildings may collapse).
    - MMI 11: Extreme (few structures remain standing).
    
- **Iso-seismal Maps**
  - Connect areas of equal strength of shaking.
  - Useful for estimating locations and magnitudes of historic earthquakes.
  - Example: 1811 New Madrid earthquake intensity estimated from felt reports.

- **Factors Affecting Intensity**
  - **Proximity to Population Centers**: Bias due to fewer settlers in the earthquake source region.
  - **Personal Account Exaggeration**: Accounts may be exaggerated or speculative.
  - **Data Sources for Modern Earthquakes**:
    - Accelerometers for strong shaking recording.
    - Felt reports collected via the internet (e.g., USGS "Did You Feel It?" service).

- **Seismic Intensity Control Factors**
  - **Directivity Effect**:
    - Slip migration direction affects ground shaking.
    - Example from 2016 Kaikoura earthquake where directivity amplified shaking.
  - **Geographical Differences**:
    - Mineral Virginia 2011 vs. Mexicali 2009:
      - Mineral Virginia had broader felt reports despite similar magnitudes.
      - Eastern US has less fault activity, enabling wider felt earthquakes.
  - **Depth of Earthquake**:
    - Ridgecrest (2019) vs. Anchorage (2018):
      - Ridgecrest was shallower and had higher peak intensities; localized shaking.
      - Anchorage was deeper with broader area of shaking but lower peak intensities.
  - **Sedimentary Basins**:
    - Anchorage within Cook Inlet amplified shaking due to loose sediments.
    - Basin amplification can prolong shaking duration and increase damage.

- **Examples of Basin Amplification and Liquefaction**
  - **Kathmandu, Nepal during Gorkha earthquake (2015)**:
    - Resonance effects observed in GPS motions due to sedimentary basin.
  - **Puebla Earthquake (2017)**:
    - Strong shaking experienced 100 km from epicenter due to basin effects in Mexico City.

- **Liquefaction Effects**
  - Water-saturated soils lose strength when shaken.
  - Damage observed in Anchorage (2018) linked to liquefaction, specifically in marshy areas.

- **Risk Evaluation for Victoria vs. Vancouver**
  - Victoria closer to subduction zone but built on solid bedrock.
  - Vancouver constructed on softer sediment, likely experiencing more amplification effects.

- **Types of Earthquakes Hazardous to Coastal BC**
  - **Three categories explored**:
    - **Megathrust earthquakes** (magnitude 8-9).
    - **Intermediate depth intraslab earthquakes**.
    - **Shallow crustal earthquakes**.
  - Crustal earthquakes pose localized hazards while megathrust earthquakes present cumulative risks.

- **Global Patterns of Earthquake Damage**
  - Majority of deadliest earthquakes (20th/21st centuries) involve shallow continental faults (magnitude 7-8).
  - Subduction zone earthquakes, although larger, have resulted in fewer fatalities relative to continental earthquakes.
