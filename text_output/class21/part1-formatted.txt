- **Lecture Focus**: Flooding Hazards
  - Definition: Flooding is the overflow or accumulation of water that submerges normally dry land.
  - Causes:
    - Water escaping from rivers, lakes, oceans
    - Accumulation of rainwater or meltwater on impermeable ground
  - Previous Coverage: Coastal flooding from storm surges and tsunamis
  - Today's Focus: Inland flooding hazards

- **Global Flooding Hazards**:
  - Affects more people than any other natural hazard
  - One third of Earth's land surface at risk
  - 2000-2018: 2.23 million km² land inundated, affecting nearly 300 million people
  - Increasing flood risks due to:
    - Climate change (increased frequency/severity of floods)
    - Growth in flood-prone populations and economic activities

- **Types of Flooding**:
  - Two broad classes:
    - **Hydro-meteorological Floods**: Related to weather
    - **Outburst Floods**: Caused by catastrophic failure of natural dams

- **Deadly Nature of Flooding**:
  - Accounts for many deadliest natural disasters (e.g., 1931 Yangtze River floods)
  - Long-lasting impacts on infrastructure, water supplies, agriculture

- **Hydrometeorological Floods**:
  - Focus on two types:
    - **Pluvial Floods**: Caused by heavy rainfall independent of overflowing water bodies (localized, common in urban areas)
    - **Fluvial Floods**: Result when rivers burst their banks
  - Key Processes:
    - **Infiltration**: Water entering soil to become groundwater
    - **Runoff/Overland Flow**: Occurs when precipitation exceeds infiltration capacity

- **Floodplain Dynamics**:
  - Floodplains as attractive areas for human activity due to:
    - Access to fresh water
    - Fertile land for farming
    - Transportation advantages
    - Flat land for construction
  - Classification by flood frequency aids in zoning for infrastructure:
    - Hospitals and evacuation centers: No flood risk
    - Homes: Low flood risk
    - Agriculture, recreation: Higher flood risk
  - **100-Year Floodplain**: 1% annual probability, does not guarantee time intervals between floods

- **Meteorological Causes of Floods**:
  - **Atmospheric Rivers**: Long, narrow bands of moist air transporting water vapor
    - Example: "Pineapple Express" from Hawaii
    - Can bring significant rainfall, causing flooding and landslides
  - **Flash Floods**: Sudden and intense rainfall over short duration
    - E.g., Boulder, Colorado flood (September 2013) with 9 inches of rain

- **Safety Concerns**:
  - Flash floods frequently result in fatalities (e.g., people attempting to drive through flooded roads)
  - Recommendation against camping in narrow canyons or dry stream beds during periods of potential flooding

- **Special Types of Floods**:
  - **Rain on Snow Floods**: Heavy rain on snowpack can lead to significant surface runoff
  - **Ice Jams**: Accumulation of ice causing flooding upstream and downstream
    - Major cause of flooding along Canadian rivers

- **Non-Hydrometeorological Floods**:
  - Landslide deposits can block rivers (e.g., Atabad Lake, Pakistan)
  - Volcanic materials and glaciers can create natural dams leading to catastrophic outburst floods (e.g., Jökullalps in Iceland)

- **Case Studies and Examples**:
  - Ice jams in New York and New Brunswick
  - Jökullalps triggered by sub-glacial volcanic eruptions in Iceland
