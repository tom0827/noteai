- **Introduction to Earthquake Risks**
  - Focus on earthquake risks and risk reduction
  - Risk = Hazard × Vulnerability
  - Importance of reducing vulnerability

- **Pillars of Emergency Management**
  - **Mitigation:** Preventing future hazards or reducing effects
  - **Preparedness:** Preparing to handle emergencies before they occur
  - **Response:** Safe reaction to emergencies
  - **Recovery:** Return to normal after emergencies

- **Global Trends in Earthquake Risks**
  - Increased fatalities in large earthquakes over the last centuries
  - Explanations for increased fatalities:
    - No evidence for increased earthquake frequency
    - Increased population and urbanization

- **Population and Earthquake Risk**
  - Graph showing global population growth and cumulative earthquake fatalities
  - Rise in the number of large cities and megacities
  - Hazardous regions: Alpine-Himalayan belt, high population density areas (China, India)

- **Seismic Hazard Factors**
  - Geographic areas prone to large earthquakes
  - Notable countries at risk: Iran, Turkey, China, India
  - Vulnerability × Hazard = Risk framework visualized through maps

- **Mitigation Strategies**
  - Primary focus on building design to withstand earthquakes
 
- **Building Material Considerations**
  - **Masonry buildings:** Rigid, brittle, susceptible to collapse
    - Example: Adobe structures in Bam, Iran (90% destruction in 2003 earthquake)
  - **Wood:** Flexible, lightweight, better performance in earthquakes
    - Example: Wood frame houses survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake
  - **Steel:** Strong and flexible but expensive, used in large buildings

- **Building Design Factors**
  - Importance of proper anchoring to strong foundations
  - Risks of sliding off foundations
  - **Soft First Story Collapse:**
    - Multi-story buildings with large openings (e.g. garages) prone to collapse
    - Illustrations of soft story failures in various earthquakes

- **Engineering Solutions for Older Buildings**
  - Retrofitting older buildings to meet codes for seismic safety
  - Historical masonry buildings requiring expensive retrofits
  - Mandatory soft story retrofits in some regions (e.g., California)
   
- **Natural Resonance of Buildings**
  - Relation between building height and resonance frequency
  - Buildings sway at frequencies related to their height
  - Effects of seismic waves on buildings:
    - Example: Mexico City earthquakes (1985 vs. 2017)
  
- **Strategies to Mitigate Resonance Effects**
  - Use of shock absorbers to dampen vibrations
  - Base isolation techniques to protect buildings
    - Example: The Cube building in Vancouver with base isolation design

### Earthquake Prediction, Forecasting, Early Warning, and Rapid Response

#### Overview of Emergency Management
- Four pillars of emergency management.
- **Mitigation**: Costly to retrofit old buildings; money should be wisely spent on high-need areas.
- Importance of **earthquake prediction** and **forecasting** for preparedness.

#### Earthquake Prediction
- Specifies:
  - **Location**
  - **Timing**
  - **Magnitude**
- Must pass statistical tests to be valid.
- Predictions based on **precursor events** (e.g., foreshocks, electrical disturbances, strange animal behaviors).
- **Haicheng (1975)**: Successful prediction led to evacuation but still resulted in 2,000 deaths.
- Contrast with **Tangshan (1976)**: No prediction or evacuation led to 250,000 deaths.
- **Limitations**: Only ~5% of large earthquakes have foreshocks; foreshocks are indistinguishable from regular seismic activity.

#### Earthquake Forecasting
- Distinct from prediction; assesses the probability of an earthquake of a given magnitude in a specified area over a long interval (e.g., 50 years).
- Illustrated using California's earthquake forecast:
  - **Red polygons**: ~10% chance of a >6.7 magnitude earthquake in 30 years.
  - **Orange**: ~1% chance.
  - **Green**: ~0.1% chance.
- Forecasts utilize:
  1. **Active fault locations**: Mapped through surface geology, remote sensing, seismicity.
  2. **Strain accumulation rates**: Measured via GPS networks.
  3. **Earthquake recurrence intervals**: Estimated through paleoseismology, examining old earthquakes.

#### Cascadia Megathrust Example
- **50-year probability** for magnitude 8-9 earthquakes: Ranges from ~12% to ~33%.
- Data sources:
  - Recorded fault characteristics.
  - Strain accumulation rates (4 cm/year).
  - Prehistoric earthquake records obtained from turbidite deposits.

#### Regional Forecasting Limitations
- In many areas (e.g., most of Canada), the data for effective forecasting are lacking.
- Use qualitative hazard estimates where data are insufficient.
- **National Seismic Hazard Map**: Indicates relative likelihood of earthquakes in regions without detailed probabilistic forecasting.

#### Earthquake Early Warning Systems
- Not the same as prediction; alerts issued post-initiation of rupture.
- Relies on the rapid detection and location of earthquakes using P waves.
- System requirements:
  1. **Seismic station network**.
  2. **Automated algorithms** for rapid evaluation.
  3. **Communication infrastructure** for alerts and safety measures (e.g., alerts to machinery, trains).
- Example: Successful early warning during the **2017 Puebla earthquake**.

#### Earthquake Preparedness
- Education campaigns are crucial.
- Recommended actions:
  - Know emergency procedures (drop, cover, hold on).
  - Prepare emergency kits and grab-and-go bags.
  - Participate in earthquake drills (e.g., **ShakeOut exercise** in October).

#### Earthquake Response
- **Rapid response** is critical; most deaths occur due to collapsing buildings.
- Importance of fast assessment of building damage for efficient search and rescue.
- Computer algorithms can rapidly estimate damage distribution.
- Key information needed for mapping human impact:
  - Shaking intensity data.
  - Population exposure data.
  - Building safety standards.

#### Tools for Rapid Assessment
- **PAGER (Prompt Assessment of Global Earthquakes for Response)**: Quickly estimates population exposure and potential fatalities.
- Example: PAGER estimate within minutes of the **2018 Palau earthquake**.
  
#### Challenges in Reporting and Response
- Governments/authorities may initially underestimate fatalities (e.g., Palau earthquake).
- Delay in recognizing true impacts can hinder timely assistance (e.g., Italy's L'Aquila earthquake).
- Remote sensing and satellite imagery can enhance damage assessment.
- **INSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar)**: Can penetrate cloud cover; useful for mapping damage.

### Conclusion
- Ongoing development of early warning and damage assessment systems enhances earthquake preparedness, response, and ultimately saves lives.
