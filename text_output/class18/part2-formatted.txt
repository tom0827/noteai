### Overview of Tsunamis and Seiches Triggered by Landslides

- **Case Studies**
  - **1958 Lituya Bay Tsunami (Alaska)**
  - **2017 Nugatsiak Tsunami (Greenland)**
  - **1929 Grand Bank Tsunami (Atlantic Canada)**
  - **1959 Hegman Lake Seiche (Montana)**
  
- **Relevance to British Columbia**
  - Lituya Bay and Nugatsiak tsunamis occurred in fjords similar to BC's coastline.
  - Grand Bank tsunami involved steep continental slopes like those offshore Vancouver Island.
  - Hegman Lake seiche occurred in a lake similar to many in BC.

- **Earthquake Activity**
  - Three case studies were triggered by earthquakes.
  - BC is Canada's most seismically active province.
  - Some events may have been exacerbated by anthropogenic climate change.

### Detailed Case Studies

#### 1958 Lituya Bay Tsunami
- **Location**: Southeastern Alaska, Pacific North America plate boundary.
- **Earthquake**: Magnitude 7.8 on July 9, 1958, at the Fairweather Fault.
- **Landslide**: 
  - Triggered by the earthquake, a 40 million m³ slab of rock fell from 900m into the bay.
  - Possible precondition due to retreat of Lituya Glacier.
- **Tsunami Wave Characteristics**:
  - Maximum run-up height: 524m, largest mega-tsunami recorded.
  - Scientists proposed wave height attributed to an air cavity created by the landslide's speed.
  - The wave reached the bay entrance in about 5 minutes at ~150 km/h.

- **Boat Accounts**:
  - **Edry**: Survived by riding over the wave.
  - **Badger**: Was carried over and sank but crew escaped.
  - **Sunmoor**: Engulfed by wave; crew lost.

- **Recurring Hazard in Lituya Bay**:
  - Previous evidence of large waves documented; frequency increasing due to glacier retreat.

#### 2017 Nugatsiak Tsunami
- **Location**: Nugatsiak, Greenland.
- **Event**: Tsunami on June 17, 2017, after a Magnitude 4.2 earthquake.
- **Tsunami Source**:
  - Sequence of events began with a landslide, estimated at 55 million m³.
  - Landslide scar visible, and tsunami wave reached 10 meters, inundating 150 meters onto land.
  
- **Impact**: 
  - 11 houses swept into the sea; four fatalities from a small population (84).

#### 1929 Grand Bank Tsunami
- **Location**: Grand Banks, off Newfoundland.
- **Earthquake**: Magnitude 7.2 on November 18, 1929, generating turbidity currents.
- **Effects**: 
  - Severed transatlantic telegraph cables due to underwater landslides.
  - Tsunami arrived 2.5 hours later, inundating coastal areas and killing 28 people.
  - Wave heights of 4 to 30 meters reported.

### 1959 Hegman Lake Seiche
- **Location**: Hegman Lake, Montana, near Yellowstone National Park.
- **Earthquake**: Magnitude 7.5 on August 17, 1959.
- **Effects**:
  - Triggered a seiche causing significant flooding.
  - A collapsed mountainside created Earthquake Lake, trapping campers and resulting in 28 fatalities.

### Conclusion
- **Relevance to BC**:
  - BC's geography includes steep lakes and reservoirs vulnerable to landslides and tsunamis.
  - Risk management and mitigation of landslides in BC, especially concerning dams, is a priority for geotechnical engineers. 

- **Historical Context**: 
  - Past events highlight the ongoing hazard posed by landslide-induced tsunamis and seiches, impacting unprepared communities.
