### 1980 Plinian-type Eruption of Mount St. Helens

#### Overview of the Cascade Volcanic Arc
- Stretching from Lassen Peak (northern California) to Mount Baker (Washington).
- Comprises approximately 15 tall stratovolcanoes and hundreds of smaller volcanoes.
- Fed by northeastward subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate beneath the North American Plate.
- Most present-day Cascade volcanoes are less than 2 million years old.

#### Eruption History & Activity
- Major eruptions in the Cascades occur on average twice per century over the past 4,000 years.
- Mount St. Helens is the most active volcano in the Cascades and has the highest likelihood of future eruptions.
- Prior to 1980, significant volcanic episodes included:
  - Rhyolitic lava dome (Goat Rocks) in 1843 CE.
  - Smaller Strombolian-type eruption in 1857.
  - Minor steam-driven phreatic eruptions in 1898, 1903, and 1921.

#### Pre-eruption Indicators (1980)
- Swarm of small to moderate earthquakes began mid-March 1980, indicating unrest.
- USGS monitored the volcano closely due to the significant seismic activity.
- On March 27, 1980, steam venting began through phreatic eruptions.
- Notable bulging observed on the north side, growing by several meters per day.

#### Mitigation Efforts and Eruption Context
- On April 30, 1980, a no-go zone was ordered, but logging companies influenced the radius size.
- Major eruption occurred on May 18, 1980, following a landslide and a magnitude 5.1 earthquake.
- The landslide decreased pressure in the magma chamber, triggering a lateral blast.

#### Eruption Dynamics
- The lateral blast occurred, blowing pyroclastic material and producing massive pyroclastic flows.
- Eruption characterized by an explosive lateral blast, creating a caldera and a vertical eruption column.

#### Impact and Damage
- Major destruction extended beyond the 5-mile evacuation zone.
- Affected areas documented with LiDAR 30 years later; landslide and pyroclastic deposits indicated eruption sequence.
- Casualties included four fatalities from the observation post and up to 40 additional deaths from the blast.

#### Long-term Consequences
- Estimated 2.3 billion cubic meters of material deposited in the North Fork of the Toutle River.
- Notable economic impact: significant timber losses and damage to the Port of Portland due to sediment deposition.
- Ash fallout reached up to 60,000 kmÂ², causing health hazards and extensive logistical issues including flight cancellations.

### Summary of Casualties and Volcanic Hazards
- Total fatalities: 57 (three inside the no-go zone, majority outside).
- Lateral blast casualties extended significantly beyond the evacuation zone.
- Continuous volcanic activity persisted post-1980; smaller eruptions occurred between May and October 1980.

### Continued Monitoring and Volcano Hazards
- Importance of volcano monitoring emphasized, following lessons from past eruptions.
- The Volcano Disaster Assistance Programme aims to assist in volcano monitoring and hazard mitigation.
- Increasing monitoring techniques include gas emissions, surface deformation, and seismic activity detection.

This structured format provides key points and detailed information to aid in studying the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980 and related volcanic phenomena.
