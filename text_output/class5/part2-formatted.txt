- **Introduction to Seismic Waves**
  - Two basic categories of seismic waves:
    - **Surface Waves**
      - Travel around the Earth's surface (analogous to ripples in a pond).
      - Slower than body waves (typically 2-3 km/s).
    - **Body Waves**
      - Pass through the Earth's interior.
      - Faster than surface waves, reaching distant points sooner.

- **Characteristics of Seismic Wave Propagation**
  - Body waves form a curved path within the Earth.
  - Material properties change with depth:
    - Silicate rocks become denser and stiffer with increasing depth.
  - Seismic wave velocities:
    - Deep mantle: fastest
    - Upper mantle: slower
    - Surface: slowest

- **Types of Body Waves**
  - **P Waves (Primary Waves)**
    - Fastest seismic waves, arrive first.
    - Particles move in the same direction as the wave (compression).
    - Can travel through liquids (e.g., molten iron outer core).
  - **S Waves (Secondary Waves)**
    - Second fastest, arrive second.
    - Particles move side-to-side, perpendicular to wave direction.
    - Cannot pass through fluids.

- **Types of Surface Waves**
  - **Love Waves**
    - Similar particle motion to S waves (side-to-side).
    - Particles at the surface move more than those at depth.
  - **Rayleigh Waves**
    - Particle motion described as a retrograde ellipse.
    - Also, particles at the surface move more than those at depth.
    - Sometimes called ground roll.

- **Seismometers and Seismograms**
  - Seismometers record ground vibrations caused by seismic waves.
    - Traditional design: weight/pendulum suspended from a frame.
  - Seismographs:
    - Instrument + recording device.
    - Seismogram: graphical representation of ground displacement over time.
    - Typically records motions along three X, Y, Z axes.

- **Identifying Seismic Waves on Seismograms**
  - P Waves: excite vertical component, arrive first.
  - S Waves: excite radial component, arrive second.
  - Surface Waves: appear later with larger amplitudes, hence more damaging.
    - Love waves: transverse component (side-to-side).
    - Rayleigh waves: excite vertical and radial components.

- **Earthquake Early Warning Systems**
  - Systems detect and locate earthquakes quickly to alert people before surface waves arrive.
  - Key to effectiveness: seismic stations surrounding the causative fault.
  - Few regions have operational early warning systems.

- **Locating Earthquakes Using Seismograms**
  - P wave travel time (Tp) < S wave travel time (Ts): Ts - Tp increases with distance.
  - Velocity: distance = time x velocity (for P and S waves).
  - Calculation example:
    - Separation time of 90 seconds, Vp = 6.0 km/s, Vs = 3.75 km/s yields a distance of 900 km to earthquake.
  - Method:
    - Plot distances on a schematic map as circles.
    - Intersection of circles locates the earthquake.

- **Global Seismology**
  - Exploits refraction and reflection of body waves at Earth's major boundaries.
    - Example: Outer core is liquid as indicated by P wave shadow zone.
  - Epicentral distance defined by angles between the earthquake, Earth's center, and distance seismometer. 

- **Future Topics**
  - Discuss magnitude and intensity scales in the next lecture.
  - Explore basin resonance and detailed impacts of seismic waves during future sessions.
