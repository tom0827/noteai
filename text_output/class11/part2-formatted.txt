### Types of Volcanic Eruptions
- **Classification Criteria**: Three Vs
  - Viscosity
  - Volatile Content
  - Volume

#### Peaceful Eruptions
- **Icelandic Eruptions**:
  - Associated with mid-ocean ridges (water depth of 2-3 km).
  - Iceland sits on mid-Atlantic ridge above sea level due to a mantle plume.
  - Characteristics:
    - High temperatures, low silica and volatile content.
    - Very low viscosity, allowing gas bubbles to escape.
    - Generally non-explosive and pose little danger.
    - Form flood basalts over geological time.
  - Example: Fagradalsfjall eruption (2021).
    - Basaltic lava forms lava fountains and rivers.
    - Horizontal layering visible in cliffs.

- **Hawaiian Eruptions**:
  - Occur on an oceanic hotspot in the middle of the Pacific Plate.
  - Chain of volcanic islands due to northwestward motion of the Pacific plate over a stationary mantle plume.
  - Types of lava:
    - **Pahoehoe**: Smooth, unbroken lava; can form lava rivers.
    - **RR Lava**: Stony, rough lava; more viscous than pahoehoe.
  - Form giant shield volcanoes, e.g., Mauna Loa.
    - Largest volcano on Earth by volume.
    - Summit height: ~4,200 m; total height from base is ~10 km.
    - Gentle slopes (~1 in 20 gradient).

#### Eruption Types in Volcanic Arcs
- **Eruption Categories** (Italian Names):
  - **Strombolian**:
    - Named after Stromboli.
    - Low to medium viscosity basaltic to andesitic magmas.
    - Mildly explosive, short bursts of ejecting glowing bombs.
    - Form cinder or scoria cones (e.g., Lassen Volcanic National Park).
  
  - **Volcanian**:
    - Named after the island of Volcano.
    - Involves andesitic or rhyolitic magma (medium to high viscosity).
    - Generates explosions, pyroclastic flows, and large blocks.
    - Fewer eruptions/year (~3 to 5).
  
  - **Plinian**:
    - Named after Pliny the Younger (Vesuvius eruption in 79 CE).
    - Highest viscosity, rhyolitic magma; very explosive.
    - Large volumes of magma ejected; can collapse into a caldera.
    - Just a few occurrences per century (four in the last 40 years; example: 1991 Mount Pinatubo).
    - Pyroclastic flows and ash fallout hazards (e.g., the impact of Typhoon Yunya).

#### Extreme Eruptions
- **Ultra-Plinian**:
  - Ejects more than 10 cubic kilometers of material; columns exceed 25 km in height.
  - Historical examples include Krakatau (1883) and Mount Tambora (1815).
  - Greatest eruption in geological history: Yellowstone (~630,000 years ago); ~1,000 cubic kilometers of pyroclastic material.

### Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI)
- Measures eruption size based on volume of pyroclastic material and height of eruption column.
- VEI Scale:
  - 0 to 1: Daily eruptions.
  - 2: Weekly eruptions.
  - 3: Yearly eruptions.
  - 4: Occur every few decades (1 cubic km of material).
  - 8: Largest eruptions, e.g., Yellowstone.

### Summary of Eruption Categories
1. **Icelandic**: Low viscosity, mafic magma - flood basalts.
2. **Hawaiian**: Basaltic magma - shield volcanoes.
3. **Strombolian**: Basaltic to andesitic magma - scoria cones.
4. **Volcanian**: Andesitic to rhyolitic magma - stratovolcanoes.
5. **Plinian**: Rhyolitic magma - larger volume, collapsing calderas.
6. **Ultra-Plinian**: Highest viscosity/volatile content - large eruptions.
