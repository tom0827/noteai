- **Overview of Lecture**
  - Focus on two significant weather hazards: tropical cyclones and tornadoes.
  - Main focus: extreme wind speeds.
  - Discussion on flooding hazards from tropical cyclones and storm surges.

- **Atmospheric Circulation Patterns**
  - Earth's heat distribution is uneven; equator receives more heat than poles.
  - Basic driver of global atmospheric circulation:
    - Winds redistribute heat from equator to poles.
  - Three different wind cells in each hemisphere:
    - Tropical Hadley cells
    - Mid-latitude Ferrel cells
    - Polar cells
    
- **Geographic Context of Wind Cells**
  - Low latitudes: 0° to 30° N/S
  - Mid-latitudes: 30° to 60° N/S
  - High latitudes: 60° to poles
  - Low pressure areas → air rises → precipitation (e.g., rainforests)
  - High pressure areas → air descends → dry regions (e.g., deserts)

- **Coriolis Effect**
  - Earth’s rotation causes winds to deflect:
    - Right in the Northern Hemisphere
    - Left in the Southern Hemisphere
  - Impacts wind patterns in low and high pressure systems.
  - Trade winds:
    - Northeast (NH) and Southeast (SH) due to Hadley cells.

- **Tropical Cyclones**
  - Defined as storms with sustained winds >120 km/h.
  - Hazards:
    - High wind speeds (up to 240 km/h).
    - Storm surges (sea level rise up to 6 metres).
    - Heavy rainfall and flooding.
  - Deadliest cyclone: 1970 Cyclone Bola (over 300,000 deaths in Bangladesh).

- **Formation of Tropical Cyclones**
  - Geographical subdivisions:
    - Hurricanes: Atlantic/Eastern Pacific.
    - Typhoons: Northwestern Pacific.
    - Cyclones: Southwestern Pacific/Indian Ocean.
  - Formation conditions:
    - Sea temperature ≥ 27°C (depths of 50m).
    - Unstable air (thunderstorms).
    - Weak vertical wind shear.

- **Stages of Tropical Cyclone Formation**
  1. **Heating**: Ocean surface warms to at least 27°C.
  2. **Evaporation**: Warm, humid air rises; water vapor condenses to form clouds.
  3. **Spin Development**: Earth's rotation causes the cyclone to spin.
  4. **Eye Formation**: Eye and eyewall develop; eye is calm, eyewall has strongest winds.

- **Naming and Categorization**
  - Early stages: 
    - Tropical disturbances (winds <40 km/h).
    - Tropical depression (winds 40-60 km/h).
    - Tropical storm (winds 60-120 km/h, given names).
    - Tropical cyclone (winds >120 km/h, categorized 1-5).
  - Saffir-Simpson scale:
    - Category 1: Minor damage.
    - Category 2: Moderate damage.
    - Category 3: Extensive structural damage.
    - Category 4: Heavy damage, significant storm surge.
    - Category 5: Catastrophic damage.

- **Hurricane Lifecycle**
  - North Atlantic hurricane season: June to November, peaks August-October.
  - Movement and decline:
    - Starts as a disturbance, moves westward, then north and east.
    - Declines after landfall or moving over cool waters.
    - Can gain strength as extra-tropical cyclones in mid-latitudes.

- **Impact on Regions**
  - Historical paths influenced by atmospheric high-pressure zones (e.g., Bermuda-Azores High).
  - Cases of western Canada affected by eastern Pacific hurricanes or typhoons.
  - Typhoon Frida (1962) was a significant event in Canada.

- **Energy of Storms**
  - Expressed in terajoules; calculated based on wind speed and size.
  - Evidence of increasing hurricane activity linked to global warming.
    - Hurricanes are longer-lasting.
    - More frequent hurricanes (e.g., 2020 Atlantic hurricane season).
