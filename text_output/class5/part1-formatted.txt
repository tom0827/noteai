- **Introduction to Earthquake Faulting and Seismic Waves**
  - Lecture 1 of 4 on earthquake hazards
  - Foundation for the module
  - Split into two parts: 
    - Study of faults and the earthquake cycle
  
- **Earthquake Cycle and Faults**
  - Concept of periodic build-up and release of stress on faults
  - Example: magnitude 7.8 Kaikoura earthquake (November 2016, New Zealand)
    - Surface rupture: pronounced linear trend of deformation
    - Common misconception: surface ruptures are not chasms; adjacent blocks slip past each other
  - **Observation of Surface Ruptures**
    - Offset roads indicate slip along a fault
    - Visual cues: fences and stream channels cut by faults

- **Fault Characteristics**
  - Fault scarp: landform resulting from vertical offset
  - Surface rupture indicates where the fault intersects Earth's surface
  - Importance of understanding that earthquakes involve slip along faults, not just points.

- **Kaikoura Earthquake Dynamics**
  - Involvement of about a dozen different faults
  - Slip movement observed along the Kekarengu fault
  - Epicenter: point where slip starts; just a reference point

- **Fault Plane Features**
  - Fault planes exhibit corrugations and striations from repeated slip
  - Smooth, polished surfaces from earthquake slip
  - Seismogenic zone: typically 10-20 kilometers deep; varies in subduction zones

- **Types of Faults**
  - **1. Reverse Faults**
    - Thrusting motion, leading to shortening and crustal thickening
    - Dip angle varies; classified as thrust faults if very low
    - Example: Chi-Chi earthquake (1999, Taiwan) and Himalayan thrust fault
  - **2. Normal Faults**
    - One side slides down leading to extension and crustal thinning
    - Typically steeper than reverse faults
    - Examples: Hebgen Lake earthquake (1959) and Norcia earthquake (2016)
  - **3. Strike-Slip Faults**
    - Lateral movement with no crustal thickening/thinning
    - Can be left-lateral or right-lateral
    - Examples: Ridgecrest earthquake (2019) and Kumamoto earthquake (2016)

- **Mapping Earthquake Surface Ruptures**
  - Importance of mapping for understanding seismic hazards
  - Traditional methods vs. modern satellite imagery techniques

- **Earthquake Slip Mechanics**
  - Stick-slip behavior: cyclic build-up of stress followed by slip
  - Earthquakes cannot be predicted due to variability in slip behavior

- **Inter-Seismic and Co-Seismic Phases**
  - Inter-seismic: gradual build-up of strain, causing slight warping
  - Co-seismic: rapid release of strain leading to surface offsets
  - Example of actual fence offset from the Darfield earthquake (2010) 

- **Long-term Earthquake Cycles**
  - Geological offsets represent cumulative impacts of multiple earthquakes
  - Major earthquakes re-trigger existing faults, not create new ones

- **Subduction Zone Earthquake Cycle**
  - Involves vertical and horizontal motions
  - Long-term convergence: overriding plate bulges and then rapidly releases during an earthquake
  - Tsunami generation associated with offshore uplift during co-seismic phase

- **Conclusion**
  - Overview of the mechanisms and types of faults related to earthquake dynamics and hazards.
