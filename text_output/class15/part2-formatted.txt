### Mount Meagher Landslide Case Study (2010)

#### Location and Geological Context
- **Mount Meagher**: 150 km north of Vancouver, 240 km north of Victoria
- **Geological Formation**: Stratovolcano in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt, part of the Cascade Volcanic Arc.
- **Eruption History**: 
  - Erupted approximately 2,400 years ago (vulcanian-style).
  - Erosion by glaciers has stripped volcanic rocks and obscured eruption history.

#### Landslide Details
- **Date and Time**: August 6, 2010, at 3:27 AM.
- **Initial Events**: Series of major rockfalls on the southeastern slope.
- **Volume of Rock Involved**: Estimated at 50 million cubic meters (third largest in Canadian history).
- **Impact Zone**: Rockfall fell about 500 meters onto Capricorn Creek, leading to a fluidized debris flow.
- **Travel Distance**: Landslide material traveled 13 km horizontally, 2 km vertically.

#### Effects and Observations
- **Speed**: Average speed of rock avalanche â€“ 70 m/s; slowed to 20 m/s in Meagher Creek.
- **Seismic Signature**: Landslide detected by seismometers, comparable in amplitude to a magnitude 3 earthquake.
- **Eyewitness Accounts**: Four campers heard sounds and escaped just before being inundated by mud.

#### Historical Context
- **Landslide Record**: Prior examples indicate larger debris flows sourced from Mount Meagher have occurred in the past 12,000 years.
- **Potential Debris Flow Volume**:
  - 100 million cubic meters needed to impact Pemberton.
  - Estimated 1 billion cubic meters for significant town reach.

### Landslide Risks and Mitigation

#### Global Landslide Statistics
- **Fatalities from 2004-2010**: Approximately 32,000 deaths due to landslides.
- **Comparison to Earthquakes**: Landslides generally result in numerous smaller fatalities versus large earthquakes.

#### Canadian Context
- **Higher Risk in Western Canada**: 
  - Steep topography and glacier influence increase landslide hazards.
  - Population distribution exacerbates vulnerability.

### Mitigation Strategies
- **Residential Zoning**: Use of landslide hazard maps for development restrictions.
- **Hazard Removal Techniques**: 
  - Scalping and benching to mitigate risks on small slopes.
  - Support techniques for rotational rock slides via unloading or reinforcing.

#### Water Management
- **Drainage**: Properly draining hill slopes can significantly reduce landslide risks.

#### Emergency Preparedness
- **Early Warning Systems**: Insufficient systems noted; need for established protocols (e.g., geophones).
- **Monitoring Technologies**: 
  - INSAR technology for identifying slope instability.
  - Application of real-time monitoring instruments.

### Additional Notes
- **Coastal Erosion Concerns**: 
  - Beaches as natural defense but require stabilization against wave action.
- **Debris Flow in Switzerland**: Example of effective warning systems in place. 

This concludes the summary of the Mount Meagher landslide case study and the discussion on landslide risks and mitigation strategies.
