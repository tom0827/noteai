- **Plate Tectonics Overview**
  - Earth's outer lithosphere is divided into rigid plates.
  - Plates move relative to one another, driven by mantle convection.
  - Results in geological phenomena: earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, landslides, and tsunamis.
  - Understanding tectonics is crucial for studying geological hazards.

- **Historical Development**
  - Early theories of continental drift (early 20th century).
  - Plate tectonics developed in the 1960s.

- **Evidence for Continental Drift**
  - **Geological Fit**: Continents fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.
    - Noted by Abraham Ortelius in the late 16th century.
    - Notable fits: Eastern Brazil and Gulf of Guinea, North America and North Africa/Europe, Antarctica and surrounding continents.
  - **Alfred Wegener (1912)**: Proposed the existence of Pangaea.
    - Pangaea = "all land"; Panthalassa = "all sea".
    - Suggested continents drifted into current positions.
  - **Geological Clues**:
    - Similar geological features on opposing Atlantic sides (e.g., Appalachian Mountains and Caledonian Mountains).
    - Fossil evidence: Specific fossils (e.g., Misosaurus, Cynognathus) found on matching continental margins.
  - **Glacial Evidence**: 
    - Glacial striations and roche moutonn√©es indicating past ice flow directions.
    - Evidence found in non-glaciated regions when continents restored to Pangaea.

- **Supercontinent Cycle**
  - Pangaea existed from 330 to 180 million years ago.
  - Split into Laurasia (North) and Gondwanaland (South) around 180 million years ago.

- **Plate Boundaries**
  - **Divergent Boundaries** (e.g., Mid-Atlantic Ridge): Plates move apart, creating new lithosphere.
  - **Convergent Boundaries**: Plates move toward each other; results in subduction or continental collision.
    - Subduction zones (e.g., Cascadia subduction zone).
    - Continental collision examples: Himalayas from the India-Eurasia collision.
  - **Strike-Slip Boundaries**: Plates slide past one another (e.g., San Andreas fault).

- **Plate Tectonics Mechanism**
  - Rigid tectonic plates move due to mantle convection.
  - Plates move along boundaries, resulting in earthquakes and volcanoes.

- **Seafloor Spreading**
  - New oceanic crust is formed at mid-ocean ridges via magma eruptions (basalt).
  - Symmetric magnetic anomalies detected on either side of the mid-ocean ridge.
  - Decompression melting occurs at mid-ocean ridges.

- **Geophysical Evidence**
  - Bathymetric data: mapping of ocean floor revealed seafloor spreading and mid-ocean ridges.
  - Magnetometry: shows magnetic striping pattern in oceanic crust.
  - Paleomagnetism: studies past changes in Earth's magnetic field and geomagnetic reversals.

- **Subduction Zones**
  - Old, cold, dense oceanic lithosphere subducts below buoyant lithosphere, forming trenches.
  - Release of water from the subducting oceanic crust causes melting and volcanism.
  - Volcanic arcs (continental arcs and island arcs) are located above subduction zones (e.g., Cascades, Aleutians).

- **Earthquake Distribution**
  - Seismological data shows earthquake epicenters along plate boundaries.
  - Wadati-Benioff zones: deep seismic activity in subduction zones.

- **Volcanism Differences**
  - Mid-ocean ridges: decompression melting; relatively peaceful eruptions.
  - Subduction zones: addition of water leads to lower solidus and explosive eruptions.

- **Future Projections**
  - Models speculate future continental drift, including the formation of a new supercontinent.
