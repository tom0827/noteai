### Water Wave Hazards: Overview

#### 1. Types of Waves
- **Tsunami Waves**: 
  - Generated by sudden displacement of ocean water, often due to geological processes like underwater earthquakes.
  
- **Seiche Waves**: 
  - Caused by displacement of water in enclosed basins (lakes, fjords), can be due to geological processes or weather conditions.

#### 2. Physics of Water Surface Waves
- **Water Surface Waves**:
  - Occur on the free surface of water bodies, primarily caused by wind.
  - Characteristics:
    - Amplitude: Half the height difference between the wave crest and trough.
    - Wavelength: Distance between successive crests.
    - Period: Time taken to move one wavelength.
   
- **Deep Water Waves**:
  - Wave shape approximates a sine wave.
  - Move directionally with wind, while water molecules move in prograde ellipses.

- **Wave Base**: 
  - Depth at which water molecules cease to move, approximately half the wavelength.

- **Shoaling**:
  - As waves enter shallow water, they slow down and increase in height as wavelength shortens.

#### 3. Differences Between Wind Waves and Tsunami Waves
- **Wind Waves**:
  - Affect only the uppermost layer of water (wavelength: tens to hundreds of meters).
  - Travel at 10-30 meters/second.
  - Typically do not have additional water mass behind waves.

- **Tsunami Waves**:
  - Affect the entire water column from surface to seafloor (can displace water over hundreds of kilometers).
  - Have tremendous momentum, allowing flooding much further inland.

#### 4. Causes of Tsunami Waves
- **Volcanic Eruptions**:
  - Can generate tsunamis through pyroclastic flows or submarine eruptions (e.g., 2003 Soufriere Hills, 2009 Tonga eruption).

- **Landslides**:
  - Can be submarine or coastal; often too small to affect entire ocean basins but can cause local devastation (e.g., 1958 Lituya Bay).

- **Submarine Earthquakes**:
  - Particularly from megathrust earthquakes at subduction zones, displacing vast volumes of water.

#### 5. Propagation of Tsunami Waves
- Influenced by:
  - Initial surface displacement, bottom topography, coastline shape.
  
- **Wave Behavior**:
  - Waves travel fast (200 m/s in deep water) but slow and bend as they enter shallower regions.
  - Example: 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami resulted from a 9.2 magnitude earthquake.

#### 6. Tsunami Inundation Characteristics
- **Run-Up**: 
  - Defined by the height above normal sea level when the wave reaches the coastline.
  
- **Inundation Distance**: 
  - Maximum horizontal extent inland.
  
- **Flow Depth**: 
  - Vertical height of water flooding inland.
  
- Variation in inundation results from coastal topography; examples include:
  - **Banda Aceh**: Flow depth exceeded 5m, inundating 4km inland (2004 tsunami).
  - **Kuji, Miyako, Kesenuma, Sendai**: Various impacts due to geographic features.

#### 7. Historical Context of Tsunamis
- **2011 Tohoku Tsunami**:
  - Caused by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake; extensive local and global impact.
  
- **Comparative Events**:
  - 1896 & 1933 tsunamis similarly occurred due to megathrust earthquakes.
  - Past events often resulted in significant loss of life due to inadequate preparedness.

### Study Notes
- Understand the mechanics of wave generation, propagation, and inundation for both tsunami and wind waves.
- Familiarize with historical tsunamis to grasp their impact and the importance of preparedness.
- Pay attention to how local geography can dramatically affect tsunami impacts, emphasizing the need for awareness of local evacuation routes and protocols.
