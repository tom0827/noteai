### Canadian Case Studies on Flooding

#### Overview of Flood Prone Areas 
- Approximately 10% of Canadians live in flood prone areas.
- Significant metropolitan areas affected: 
  - Toronto
  - Vancouver
  - Calgary
  - Montreal
  - Edmonton
- Most flood prone city: Winnipeg, Manitoba.

#### Flooding Events in Winnipeg
- Major flooding events:
  - **1950**: Historical flooding; significant damage and evacuations.
  - **1993**: Featured in costliest Canadian natural disasters.
  - **1997**: Severe flooding; significant impact on the city.

- **1950 Flood Details**:
  - Lasted from mid-April to mid-June.
  - Approximately 1,600 km² of agricultural land inundated.
  - Dikes around Winnipeg breached; leading to significant urban flooding.
  - 100,000 people evacuated (one-third of Winnipeg's population).
  - Over 10,000 buildings flooded; losses exceeded $1 billion in today’s money.
  - Resulted in the construction of the Red River floodway in the 1960s.

- **Red River Floodway**:
  - Purpose: Divert floodwater around Winnipeg.
  - Capacity: Diverted up to 1,700 m³/s of water.
  - Cost: $63 million at the time (about $500 million today).
  - Recognized as a national historic civil engineering site.

- **1997 Flood Response**:
  - Severe flooding due to snowpack and rapid thaw.
  - Floodway capacity doubled in the early 2000s at an additional cost of $600 million.

#### Recent Fraser River Flooding
- **Fraser River Overview**:
  - Largest river on Canada’s west coast, drains significant surface area of BC.
  - Major floods recorded in spring (1894, 1948).

- **November 2021 Flooding Event**:
  - Caused by an intense atmospheric river; record-breaking rainfall in several areas.
  - Virgin ground already saturated from previous conditions; exacerbated by recent wildfires.
  - Significant infrastructure damage:
    - City of Merritt evacuated; wastewater treatment plant flooded.
    - Highways (Highway 1, Highway 5, Highway 8) damaged or destroyed in multiple locations.
    - Railways (CP and CN) were temporarily closed, impacting supply chains.

- **Impacts on Agriculture**:
  - Sumas Prairie, a key agricultural area, severely flooded.
  - Emergency evacuations led to abandonment of livestock and damages to farms.

#### Long-term Climate Impact
- Anthropogenic climate change is increasing flooding severity and frequency.
  - Studies predict:
    - Up to 40% more frequent major precipitation days by mid-century.
    - Atmospheric rivers to become 25% wider and longer, carrying 50% more moisture.
- Need for better protective infrastructures and alert systems.

### Conclusion
- Upcoming lecture: examination of another natural hazard worsened by climate change, wildfires.
