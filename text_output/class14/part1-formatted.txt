### Landslides Module Overview
- **Structure**: Two lectures
  - **Lecture 1**: Introduction and theoretical basics of landslides
    - Physics of slope stability
    - Roles of water and geology
    - Difference between preconditions and triggers
  - **Lecture 2**: Detailed landslide case studies

### Key Concepts
- **Mass Movements**: Downslope movement of solid materials under gravity's influence
  - Types of mass movements: 
    - Pyroplastic flows
    - Lahars
    - Snow avalanches (not covered in this course)
- **Landslide Definition**: Movement involving rock, soil, mud, or debris (mixtures of rock, soil, and vegetation)

### Forces Involved in Landslides
- **Gravity**: Points toward Earth's center of mass
  - Components:
    - Parallel to slope (pulls material downslope)
    - Perpendicular to slope (resists motion; countered by friction)
  
### Factors Influencing Landslides
1. **Increasing Slope Angle**:
   - Abrupt increases (e.g., road cuts)
   - Gradual increases through erosion and tectonics
   - Equilibrium between uplift and erosion leads to heightened failure risk
  
2. **Adding Mass to Slope**:
   - Saturating material with water increases weight
   - Common factor in landslides
  
3. **Shaking (e.g., Earthquakes)**:
   - Ground shaking can cause fluctuations in force components
   - Can trigger landslides if frictional resistance is overcome
  
4. **Reducing Friction**:
   - Wetting or icing the slip plane
   - Reducing internal friction decreases cohesive strength

### Preconditions vs. Triggers
- **Preconditions**: Long-term factors that bring a slope close to failure (e.g., excavation, slope steepening)
- **Triggers**: Immediate events that cause a slope to fail (e.g., heavy rainfall, vibrations from trains)

### Case Studies
- **2008 Wenchuan Earthquake, China**:
  - **Precondition**: Steepened hill slopes
  - **Trigger**: Strong ground shaking from earthquake
  - Resulted in approximately 20,000 landslides and significant fatalities
  
- **Hurricane Mitch, 1998**:
  - **Precondition**: Accumulated water saturation
  - **Trigger**: Intense rainfall (up to 900 mm)
  - Led to approximately 11,000 fatalities and extensive destruction in Honduras
  
- **El Barinche Landslide**: 
  - Largest triggered by Hurricane Mitch, affecting Tegucigalpa
  
- **December 1999 Vargas State, Venezuela**:
  - **Preconditions**: Tectonic uplift, weak metamorphic bedrock
  - **Trigger**: Heavy rainfall
  - Resulted in widespread destruction and around 30,000 fatalities

### Specific Events
- **Pay El Landslide, Washington, 2007**:
  - **Trigger**: Heavy rainfall from Great Coastal Storm
  - **Preconditions**: Glacial till and human activities (road construction, logging)
  
- **Palu Earthquake, Indonesia, 2018**:
  - **Lateral spread landslide** resulted from ground shaking coupled with human-induced saturation
  
### Water's Role in Landslides
- Saturation of soil reduces internal friction and cohesive strength
- Freeze-thaw cycles can disintegrate rocks and contribute to landslides
- Groundwater intricacies can lead to sinkholes and further destabilization

### Geological Factors Influencing Landslides
- **Dissolution of minerals**: E.g., calcite in limestones can cause sinkholes
- **Clay minerals**: Become slippery when wet; prevalent in glacial deposits
- **Bedding planes**: Weak surfaces separating layers of sedimentary rock; can create preferential pathways for landslides

### Conclusion
- Landslides are complex phenomena influenced by multiple interrelated factors, including geology, water saturation, and human activities. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for risk assessment and mitigation efforts.
