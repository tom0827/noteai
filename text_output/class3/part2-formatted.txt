### Plate Boundaries

- **Types of Plate Boundaries**
  - **Continental Collision Zones**
    - Occurs when two continental plates converge.
    - Neither plate can be subducted due to buoyancy; crust thickens instead.
    - Example: Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau formed by the collision of India and Eurasia (~50-60 million years ago).
    - Average convergence rate of India towards Eurasia: ~50 mm per year.
    - Crustal thickening beneath Tibet: ~70-80 km leads to high surface elevation (~5 km).
    - Wider than subduction zones (e.g., India-Eurasia collision zone ~3,000 km wide).
    
  - **Continental Rifts**
    - Formed by the initiation of rifting due to mantle temperature anomalies.
    - Uplift of continental crust can lead to gravitational instability and subsequent rifting.
    - Formation results in rift valleys (e.g., East African Rift).
    - The rift propagates southward, featuring a spectrum of landforms and volcanism.
    - Double branches characterize the rift with notable volcanoes like Mount Kenya and Mount Kilimanjaro.
    
  - **Strike-Slip Faults**
    - Neither create nor consume lithosphere; plates slide past each other laterally.
    - Example: San Andreas Fault (right-lateral strike-slip).
    - Important for connecting mid-ocean ridge segments (transform faults).
    
- **Hotspots and Mantle Plumes**
  - Regions of volcanism above rising mantle plumes.
  - Not classified as tectonic plate boundaries.
  - Example: Hawaiian hotspot formed linear chain of islands due to plate movement over a stationary plume.
  - Yellowstone hotspot on continental crust causes different rock types compared to oceanic hotspots.

### Isostasy
- **Definition and Principle**
  - Gravitational equilibrium where crust floats on denser plastic asthenosphere.
  - Similar to objects floating on water; elevation depends on thickness and density.
  
- **Isostatic Adjustments**
  - Addition/subtraction of mass leads to elevation changes (e.g., glaciers adding mass during ice ages causing land to sink).
  - **Post-Glacial Rebound**
    - After melting of ice sheets, the crust rises back over thousands of years.
    - Continued uplift observed via GPS studies in formerly glaciated areas (e.g., eastern North America).
    - Rates of uplift can be higher in areas of active deglaciation (e.g., northwestern BC and southwestern Yukon, up to 3 cm/year).

### Geological History and Plate Motion
- **Continental Drift and Rifting**
  - Movement of tectonic plates on Earth's surface (e.g., Africa and North America once fused as Pangaea).
  - Evolution of passive and active continental margins aligning with plate tectonics.
  - Example: Passive margins in Eastern North America match with coastal Africa, formed after rifting.

### Conclusion
- Understanding these concepts is vital for assessing seismic and volcanic hazards, and characterizing geological features shaped by plate tectonics.
