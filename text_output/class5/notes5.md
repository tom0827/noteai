- **Introduction to Earthquake Faulting and Seismic Waves**
  - Lecture 1 of 4 on earthquake hazards
  - Foundation for the module
  - Split into two parts: 
    - Study of faults and the earthquake cycle
  
- **Earthquake Cycle and Faults**
  - Concept of periodic build-up and release of stress on faults
  - Example: magnitude 7.8 Kaikoura earthquake (November 2016, New Zealand)
    - Surface rupture: pronounced linear trend of deformation
    - Common misconception: surface ruptures are not chasms; adjacent blocks slip past each other
  - **Observation of Surface Ruptures**
    - Offset roads indicate slip along a fault
    - Visual cues: fences and stream channels cut by faults

- **Fault Characteristics**
  - Fault scarp: landform resulting from vertical offset
  - Surface rupture indicates where the fault intersects Earth's surface
  - Importance of understanding that earthquakes involve slip along faults, not just points.

- **Kaikoura Earthquake Dynamics**
  - Involvement of about a dozen different faults
  - Slip movement observed along the Kekarengu fault
  - Epicenter: point where slip starts; just a reference point

- **Fault Plane Features**
  - Fault planes exhibit corrugations and striations from repeated slip
  - Smooth, polished surfaces from earthquake slip
  - Seismogenic zone: typically 10-20 kilometers deep; varies in subduction zones

- **Types of Faults**
  - **1. Reverse Faults**
    - Thrusting motion, leading to shortening and crustal thickening
    - Dip angle varies; classified as thrust faults if very low
    - Example: Chi-Chi earthquake (1999, Taiwan) and Himalayan thrust fault
  - **2. Normal Faults**
    - One side slides down leading to extension and crustal thinning
    - Typically steeper than reverse faults
    - Examples: Hebgen Lake earthquake (1959) and Norcia earthquake (2016)
  - **3. Strike-Slip Faults**
    - Lateral movement with no crustal thickening/thinning
    - Can be left-lateral or right-lateral
    - Examples: Ridgecrest earthquake (2019) and Kumamoto earthquake (2016)

- **Mapping Earthquake Surface Ruptures**
  - Importance of mapping for understanding seismic hazards
  - Traditional methods vs. modern satellite imagery techniques

- **Earthquake Slip Mechanics**
  - Stick-slip behavior: cyclic build-up of stress followed by slip
  - Earthquakes cannot be predicted due to variability in slip behavior

- **Inter-Seismic and Co-Seismic Phases**
  - Inter-seismic: gradual build-up of strain, causing slight warping
  - Co-seismic: rapid release of strain leading to surface offsets
  - Example of actual fence offset from the Darfield earthquake (2010) 

- **Long-term Earthquake Cycles**
  - Geological offsets represent cumulative impacts of multiple earthquakes
  - Major earthquakes re-trigger existing faults, not create new ones

- **Subduction Zone Earthquake Cycle**
  - Involves vertical and horizontal motions
  - Long-term convergence: overriding plate bulges and then rapidly releases during an earthquake
  - Tsunami generation associated with offshore uplift during co-seismic phase

- **Conclusion**
  - Overview of the mechanisms and types of faults related to earthquake dynamics and hazards.

  - **Introduction to Seismic Waves**
  - Two basic categories of seismic waves:
    - **Surface Waves**
      - Travel around the Earth's surface (analogous to ripples in a pond).
      - Slower than body waves (typically 2-3 km/s).
    - **Body Waves**
      - Pass through the Earth's interior.
      - Faster than surface waves, reaching distant points sooner.

- **Characteristics of Seismic Wave Propagation**
  - Body waves form a curved path within the Earth.
  - Material properties change with depth:
    - Silicate rocks become denser and stiffer with increasing depth.
  - Seismic wave velocities:
    - Deep mantle: fastest
    - Upper mantle: slower
    - Surface: slowest

- **Types of Body Waves**
  - **P Waves (Primary Waves)**
    - Fastest seismic waves, arrive first.
    - Particles move in the same direction as the wave (compression).
    - Can travel through liquids (e.g., molten iron outer core).
  - **S Waves (Secondary Waves)**
    - Second fastest, arrive second.
    - Particles move side-to-side, perpendicular to wave direction.
    - Cannot pass through fluids.

- **Types of Surface Waves**
  - **Love Waves**
    - Similar particle motion to S waves (side-to-side).
    - Particles at the surface move more than those at depth.
  - **Rayleigh Waves**
    - Particle motion described as a retrograde ellipse.
    - Also, particles at the surface move more than those at depth.
    - Sometimes called ground roll.

- **Seismometers and Seismograms**
  - Seismometers record ground vibrations caused by seismic waves.
    - Traditional design: weight/pendulum suspended from a frame.
  - Seismographs:
    - Instrument + recording device.
    - Seismogram: graphical representation of ground displacement over time.
    - Typically records motions along three X, Y, Z axes.

- **Identifying Seismic Waves on Seismograms**
  - P Waves: excite vertical component, arrive first.
  - S Waves: excite radial component, arrive second.
  - Surface Waves: appear later with larger amplitudes, hence more damaging.
    - Love waves: transverse component (side-to-side).
    - Rayleigh waves: excite vertical and radial components.

- **Earthquake Early Warning Systems**
  - Systems detect and locate earthquakes quickly to alert people before surface waves arrive.
  - Key to effectiveness: seismic stations surrounding the causative fault.
  - Few regions have operational early warning systems.

- **Locating Earthquakes Using Seismograms**
  - P wave travel time (Tp) < S wave travel time (Ts): Ts - Tp increases with distance.
  - Velocity: distance = time x velocity (for P and S waves).
  - Calculation example:
    - Separation time of 90 seconds, Vp = 6.0 km/s, Vs = 3.75 km/s yields a distance of 900 km to earthquake.
  - Method:
    - Plot distances on a schematic map as circles.
    - Intersection of circles locates the earthquake.

- **Global Seismology**
  - Exploits refraction and reflection of body waves at Earth's major boundaries.
    - Example: Outer core is liquid as indicated by P wave shadow zone.
  - Epicentral distance defined by angles between the earthquake, Earth's center, and distance seismometer. 

- **Future Topics**
  - Discuss magnitude and intensity scales in the next lecture.
  - Explore basin resonance and detailed impacts of seismic waves during future sessions.
