- **Lecture Overview**
  - Application of earthquake faulting, seismic waves, magnitude, and intensity scales to real case studies.
  - Focus on:
    - Subduction zone case study: Tohoku megathrust earthquake (Japan, March 2011, magnitude 9.0).
    - Continental collision zone case study: Bam earthquake (Iran, 2003, magnitude 6.6).
    - Intraplate earthquakes: Occurring within tectonic plates.

- **Tohoku Megathrust Earthquake (March 2011)**
  - Magnitude: 9.0, second largest of our lifetimes.
  - Death Toll: Approximately 20,000 people due to triggered tsunami.
  - Comparison: Largest earthquakes (by magnitude) are not always the most damaging.
  
- **Bam Earthquake (2003)**
  - Magnitude: 6.6, death toll up to twice that of Tohoku.
  - Reflection of regional patterns: Occurrence in Mediterranean, Middle East, South and East Asia.

- **Categories of Earthquakes in Subduction Zones**
  - **Megathrust Earthquakes**
    - Shallow fault interface, can exceed moment magnitudes of 8 or 9.
  
  - **Crustal Events**
    - Smaller magnitudes (up to ~7), occur directly beneath continents, potential for severe damage.
  
  - **Intermediate-Depth Earthquakes (Intra-slab Earthquakes)**
    - Focal depths: 50 to 300 km, may reach magnitudes ~7, often normal faulting.

  - **Deep Earthquakes**
    - Depths > 300 km, rarely damaging.
  
  - **Outer Rise Earthquakes**
    - Occur at shallow depths due to flexing oceanic lithosphere.
  
  - **Volcanic Earthquakes**
    - Triggered by rising magma, typically low magnitude.

- **Case Study Examples**
  - 2017 Puebla Earthquake: Intermediate depth, caused extensive damage in Mexico City.
  - 2018 Anchorage Earthquake: Example of liquefaction effects in Alaska.
  - 2001 Nisqually Earthquake: Magnitude 6.8, caused $1-$4 billion in damages in Washington State. 

- **Earthquake Cycle at Subduction Zones**
  - Inter-seismic period: Oceanic plate converges with overriding plate, megathrust fault is locked.
  - Co-seismic phase: Sudden slip restores position, triggers tsunami.

- **Tohoku Earthquake Tectonic Setting**
  - Subduction of Pacific Plate below Japan along Japan Trench.
  - Triple junction: convergence of Pacific and Philippine Sea Plates.

- **GPS Monitoring and Inter-seismic Contraction**
  - East coast of Honshu moving towards the west at 2-3 cm/year.
  - Contraction rate indicates strain buildup.

- **Rupture Pattern and Slip Distribution**
  - Estimated fault length: 300-400 km.
  - Deepest rupture: Extended from 40 km to seafloor.
  - Peak slip: 40m, potentially up to 60m.

- **Tsunami Characteristics**
  - Tohoku tsunami height: Average 10-20m, maximum recorded height of 39m.
  - Previous tsunamis did not exceed around 6m height.

- **Paleoseismology and Historical Tsunami Evidence**
  - Study of sediment layers reveal past events similar to Tohoku.
  - Evidence suggests large tsunamis occur on average every 500-1,000 years.

- **Cascadia Megathrust Considerations**
  - Potential behavior of Cascadia similar to Japan Trench observed in Tohoku.
  - Research focuses on the shallow part of the megathrust and its implications for tsunami height.

- **Models of Potential Cascadia Earthquake**
  - Scenarios include varying peak slips (not reaching trench, reaching trench).
  - Impact on tsunami run-ups and shaking experienced in coastal regions like Victoria.

- **Final Thoughts**
  - Ongoing uncertainties in predicting impact magnitude and tsunami behavior.
  - Importance of active research and monitoring in the region.
