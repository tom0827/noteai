### Lecture Overview
- **Focus:** Case studies of tsunamis generated by megathrust earthquakes at subduction zones.
- **Key Tsunami Events:**
  - 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami
  - 2011 Tōhoku Tsunami
  - Evidence of similar megathrust tsunamis in Cascadia

### Subduction Zones and Tsunami Hazards
- **World's Subduction Zones (Highlighted in Map):**
  - **Pacific Ocean:** Greatest hazard; surrounded by subduction zones.
    - South American subduction zone (1960 Valdivia earthquake, M 9.5)
    - Japan Trench (2011 Tōhoku earthquake)
    - Cascadia subduction zone
  - **Indian Ocean:** Second highest hazard.
    - Sunda subduction zone (2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami)
    - Makran subduction zone (offshore Iran/Pakistan)
  - **Mediterranean Sea:** High hazard from African plate subduction.
  - **Atlantic Ocean:** Single subduction zone in Eastern Caribbean Sea.
    - Notable 1755 earthquake/tsunami near Portugal with 60-100,000 deaths.

### 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami
- **Event Details:**
  - Date: December 26, 2004
  - Cause: M 9.2 megathrust earthquake offshore northern Sumatra.
  - Rupture Length: 1500 kilometers (longest recorded).
  - Average rupture velocity: 3 km/s.
  - Tsunami generated significant displacement in the water column.

- **Tsunami Wave Arrival Times:**
  - **Banda Aceh:** Immediate impact, largest wave crest reached in 20-30 minutes.
  - **Phuket:** Water drawback before wave crest, occurred about 2 hours after.
  - **Sri Lanka:** First wave crest at about 2 hours after, no warning signs.

- **Death Toll:**
  - Banda Aceh: Over 100,000 deaths.
  - Thailand: Over 8,000 deaths, including tourists.
  - Sri Lanka: About 35,000 deaths.
  - India: About 16,000 deaths.
  - Somalia: Nearly 300 deaths, affected 7-8 hours later.

- **Warning Systems:** Absence of DART tsunami alert system in the Indian Ocean at the time was a critical failure.

### 2011 Tōhoku Tsunami
- **Event Details:**
  - Date: March 11, 2011
  - Cause: M 9.0 earthquake rupturing southern Japan trench.
  - Japan’s preparedness included early warning systems.

- **Impact:**
  - Tsunami walls and defenses were overrun; maximum run-up heights exceeded 10 meters.
  - Death toll approximately 18,000; many elderly victims hindered evacuation.
  - Nuclear disaster at Fukushima Daiichi due to flooding.

- **Geological Insights:**
  - Suspected large tsunamis not previously anticipated.
  - Historical sediments indicate previous similar events might occur every 500 to 1,000 years.

### Cascadia Subduction Zone Evidence
- **Geological Evidence:**
  - Ghost forests indicate past megathrust earthquakes.
  - Dated to around 1700 CE due to tree ring studies.
  - Stories from Native American oral history suggesting historical tsunami events.

### Conclusion
- **Tsunami Studies Importance:** Understanding historical data and the impacts on society can guide future preparedness and monitoring strategies in regions with similar geological risks.
