### Part 1: Continental Plate Boundary Earthquakes
- **2003 Ban Earthquake**: Main case study.
- **Types of Continental Plate Boundaries**:
  - **Convergent Collision Zones**: Example: India-Eurasia collision (Himalayas).
  - **Continental Shear Zones**: Example: San Andreas Fault, California.
  - **Divergent Continental Rifts**: Illustrated in a cartoon depiction.
  
- **Earthquake Types**:
  - Continental collision zones: Reverse or thrust faults, strike-slip faults, normal faults (e.g., Tibet).
  - Continental shear zones: Primarily strike-slip faults, but may contain reverse and normal faults.
  - Continental rifts: Mostly normal faulting, some strike-slip faults.
  
- **Seismogenic Zone**:
  - Thickness: About 15 km.
  - Earthquake depth: Typically do not exceed 30-40 km.
  - Magnitude: Large earthquakes of 7-8 common; >8 very rare.
  
- **Faulting Characteristics**:
  - Generally spread over wide plate boundary zones rather than focused on major faults.

- **Examples of Notable Earthquakes**:
  - **2016 Kaikoura Earthquake, New Zealand**: 20 individual faults, including strike-slip and reverse faults.
  - **2019 Ridgecrest Earthquake, California**: Occurred in eastern California shear zone.
  - **2016 Norcia Earthquake, Italy**: Normal faulting in Apennine Mountains.

### Part 2: 2003 Bam Earthquake Case Study
- **Location**: Southern Dasht-e Lut desert, Iran.
- **Event Date**: December 26, 2003, at 5:30 AM local time.
- **Impact**: 
  - Destruction of the medieval citadel (UNESCO site).
  - Casualties: 26,000 - 40,000 fatalities (approximately 50% of Bam's population).
  - Damage: 60% of modern buildings, 90% of older adobe structures.

- **Faulting and Analysis**:
  - Bam does not lie on any mapped fault line.
  - Satellite remote sensing (INSAR) used to reveal fault responsible.
  - Result: Identification of a main right-lateral strike-slip fault and a secondary reverse fault.

- **Geological Features**:
  - Bam-Barabat Ridge: Uplifted by repeated earthquakes.
  - Importance of **Canats**: Ancient underground irrigation tunnels reliant on raised water tables due to active faults.

### Part 3: Earthquake Preparedness in Iran
- **Seismic Hazard in Iran**:
  - Extensive active fault network indicated by mapped faults.
  - High earthquake history leading to significant fatalities.
  
- **Major Cities and Earthquake Risks**:
  - Tehranâ€™s location adjacent to active faults (North Tehran Fault).
  - Historical earthquake occurrences in Tehran (855, 958, 1177, 1830 CE).
  
- **Fatal Attraction**:
  - Urban centers situated along active faults for water access.
  - Ongoing risk of destructive earthquakes due to increasing populations in fault-prone areas.

### Part 4: Intraplate Earthquakes
- **Definition**: Earthquakes occurring within tectonic plates, not at plate boundaries.
- **Causes**:
  - Tectonic stresses from boundaries transmitting through plate interiors.
  - Internal stresses from geological processes (e.g., post-glacial rebound).

- **Notable Areas**: 
  - Charlevoix seismic zone in eastern Canada, associated with ancient faults.
  - Labrador Sea and Grand Banks: Sites of significant intraplate earthquakes historically.

- **Human-Induced Seismicity**:
  - Activities causing induced earthquakes (fluid injection, mining, reservoir impoundment).
  - **Fracking's Impact**: Dramatic increase in recorded seismicity in the US since 2009.
  
- **Canadian Context**:
  - Induced seismicity linked to fracking in northeast British Columbia and Alberta.
  - Observations of delayed seismic response to increased fracking activity.

### Conclusion
- **Understanding Earthquake Dynamics**:
  - Essential for hazard assessment and urban planning along active faults, particularly in regions like Iran and the continental margins.
