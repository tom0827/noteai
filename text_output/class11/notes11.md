- **Module Overview: Volcanic Hazards**
  - Focus on volcanoes and later explore hazards and risks of eruptions.
  - Assessment of different types of magma and erupted materials.
  - Characteristics of magma influence eruption styles (peaceful vs. dangerous).

- **Definition of Volcanic Eruptions**
  - A volcano is an opening in Earth's crust for molten rock, rock fragments, and gases.
  - Various forms of volcanoes; classic conical shape is not universal.
  
- **Types of Volcanic Hazards**
  - Lava flows
  - Pyroclastic flows
  - Volcanic bombs
  - Ashfall
  - Hazards from non-erupting volcanoes (e.g., debris avalanches)

- **Magma and Lava**
  - **Magma**: Molten or partially molten rock beneath the Earth's surface; stored in a magma chamber.
  - **Lava**: Molten rock at the Earth's surface, either flowing or airborne.
  - Includes gases produced during eruptions.
  
- **Volatiles in Magma**
  - Compounds with low boiling points kept in solution due to overlying pressure.
  - Common volatiles: Water, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide.

- **Eruption Dynamics**
  - Magma rises as pressure decreases, causing volatiles to exsolve and form bubbles.
  - Explosive eruptions fragment magma into pyroclasts.
  - Eruption columns transport material into the atmosphere, potentially reaching altitudes of 50 km.

- **Igneous Rock Types and Composition**
  - Igneous rocks categorized by silica content:
    - **Mafic**: Low silica (e.g., basalt, gabbro); low viscosity.
    - **Felsic**: High silica (e.g., rhyolite, granite); high viscosity.
    - **Intermediate**: Between mafic and felsic (e.g., andesite, diorite).
   
- **Impact of Composition on Viscosity**
  - Viscosity influenced by temperature, crystal content, and silica content.
  - Mafic magmas flow easily; felsic magmas are sticky and flow slowly.

- **Differences in Tectonic Settings**
  - **Mid-Ocean Ridges**:
    - Diverging plates, forming mafic magma through decompression melting.
    - Pillow basalts formed underwater; minimal hazard to human life.
  
  - **Volcanic Arcs**:
    - Melting occurs from subducting plates carrying water-rich sediments, forming more explosive intermediate to felsic magmas.
  
  - **Hotspots**:
    - Eruptions vary based on whether oceanic or continental plates are melted.

- **Lava Forms and Properties**
  - **Pillow Basalts**: Formed underwater, characterized by glassy skin.
  - **Pumice**: Light, frothy volcanic glass, often floats on water.
  - **Cinders (Scoria)**: Dark, heavier pyroclasts, used in landscaping.
  - **Bombs and Blocks**: Large pyroclasts formed from basaltic eruptions; bombs are liquid during ejection.

- **Pyroclastic Materials**
  - **Ash**: Small particles that can be transported over large distances; dangerous.
  - **Pyroclastic Flows**: High-density flows of pyroclasts and gases; extremely deadly.

- **Volcanic Gases**
  - Dominated by water vapor; other gases include carbon dioxide, methane, and sulfur compounds.
  - Fumaroles release gases; sulfur deposits are indicative.

- **Benefits of Volcanic Soils**
  - Rich in nutrients from volcanic minerals.
  - Volcanic soils are some of the most fertile on Earth, balancing risks and benefits for human habitation.

### Types of Volcanic Eruptions
- **Classification Criteria**: Three Vs
  - Viscosity
  - Volatile Content
  - Volume

#### Peaceful Eruptions
- **Icelandic Eruptions**:
  - Associated with mid-ocean ridges (water depth of 2-3 km).
  - Iceland sits on mid-Atlantic ridge above sea level due to a mantle plume.
  - Characteristics:
    - High temperatures, low silica and volatile content.
    - Very low viscosity, allowing gas bubbles to escape.
    - Generally non-explosive and pose little danger.
    - Form flood basalts over geological time.
  - Example: Fagradalsfjall eruption (2021).
    - Basaltic lava forms lava fountains and rivers.
    - Horizontal layering visible in cliffs.

- **Hawaiian Eruptions**:
  - Occur on an oceanic hotspot in the middle of the Pacific Plate.
  - Chain of volcanic islands due to northwestward motion of the Pacific plate over a stationary mantle plume.
  - Types of lava:
    - **Pahoehoe**: Smooth, unbroken lava; can form lava rivers.
    - **RR Lava**: Stony, rough lava; more viscous than pahoehoe.
  - Form giant shield volcanoes, e.g., Mauna Loa.
    - Largest volcano on Earth by volume.
    - Summit height: ~4,200 m; total height from base is ~10 km.
    - Gentle slopes (~1 in 20 gradient).

#### Eruption Types in Volcanic Arcs
- **Eruption Categories** (Italian Names):
  - **Strombolian**:
    - Named after Stromboli.
    - Low to medium viscosity basaltic to andesitic magmas.
    - Mildly explosive, short bursts of ejecting glowing bombs.
    - Form cinder or scoria cones (e.g., Lassen Volcanic National Park).
  
  - **Volcanian**:
    - Named after the island of Volcano.
    - Involves andesitic or rhyolitic magma (medium to high viscosity).
    - Generates explosions, pyroclastic flows, and large blocks.
    - Fewer eruptions/year (~3 to 5).
  
  - **Plinian**:
    - Named after Pliny the Younger (Vesuvius eruption in 79 CE).
    - Highest viscosity, rhyolitic magma; very explosive.
    - Large volumes of magma ejected; can collapse into a caldera.
    - Just a few occurrences per century (four in the last 40 years; example: 1991 Mount Pinatubo).
    - Pyroclastic flows and ash fallout hazards (e.g., the impact of Typhoon Yunya).

#### Extreme Eruptions
- **Ultra-Plinian**:
  - Ejects more than 10 cubic kilometers of material; columns exceed 25 km in height.
  - Historical examples include Krakatau (1883) and Mount Tambora (1815).
  - Greatest eruption in geological history: Yellowstone (~630,000 years ago); ~1,000 cubic kilometers of pyroclastic material.

### Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI)
- Measures eruption size based on volume of pyroclastic material and height of eruption column.
- VEI Scale:
  - 0 to 1: Daily eruptions.
  - 2: Weekly eruptions.
  - 3: Yearly eruptions.
  - 4: Occur every few decades (1 cubic km of material).
  - 8: Largest eruptions, e.g., Yellowstone.

### Summary of Eruption Categories
1. **Icelandic**: Low viscosity, mafic magma - flood basalts.
2. **Hawaiian**: Basaltic magma - shield volcanoes.
3. **Strombolian**: Basaltic to andesitic magma - scoria cones.
4. **Volcanian**: Andesitic to rhyolitic magma - stratovolcanoes.
5. **Plinian**: Rhyolitic magma - larger volume, collapsing calderas.
6. **Ultra-Plinian**: Highest viscosity/volatile content - large eruptions.
