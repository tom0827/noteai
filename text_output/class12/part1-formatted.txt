- **Introduction to Volcanic Hazards**
  - Focus on hazards associated with volcanoes and eruptions.
  - Case studies will illustrate different types of hazards.
  - Importance of volcano monitoring to reduce risks.

- **Types of Volcanic Hazards**
  - Not all volcanic hazards impact the same way; some are more severe.
  - Hazards vary from local to global impacts.
  - Excluded from this lecture: debris avalanches and tsunamis (covered in separate modules).

- **Case Study: Eruption of Kilauea, 2018**
  - Kilauea is an active shield volcano in Hawaii.
  - Eruption began on May 3rd, continuing for several weeks.
  - Damage to Leilani Estates: 2,000 residents evacuated, $800 million in damages, 24 injuries, no fatalities.
  - Lava flows characterized by smooth pahoehoe and viscous a’a types.

- **Pyroclastic Flows**
  - Very deadly volcanic hazard associated with several eruption types.
  - Contains ash and gases; can travel at high speeds (up to 700 km/h).
  - Example: 1902 eruption of Mount Pele killed 30,000 residents of Saint-Pierre.
  - Formation can occur through:
    - Collapse of a lava dome.
    - Spillover from a lava lake.
    - Lateral blast from an eruption.
    - Collapse of a volcanic plume.

- **Case Study: Mount Unzen, 1991**
  - First pyroclastic flow caught on film led to 43 deaths.
  - Pyroclastic flows can be unpredictable; prior knowledge has improved monitoring strategies.

- **Phreatic Eruptions**
  - Occur when magma contacts groundwater, resulting in explosive steam.
  - Example: Mount Ontake eruption in 2014 with no warning, killing 63 people.
  - Example: Whakaari/White Island eruption in 2019 killed 22 tourists and injured many others.

- **Limnic Eruptions**
  - Sudden release of lake gases can be deadly.
  - Example: Lake Nyos disaster, 1986, killed over 1,700 due to CO2 release.
  - Degassing programs have been initiated in response to past eruptions.
  
- **Lahars**
  - Volcanic mudflows formed from pyroclastic material, water, and debris.
  - Can follow existing channels and vary in speed from 1 to 40 m/s.
  - Example: Nevado del Ruiz lahar in 1985, killed 23,000 people.

- **Volcanic Ash Hazards**
  - Ash from eruptions can damage aircraft and cause extensive travel disruptions.
  - Example: Eyjafjallajökull eruption in 2010 led to significant air traffic shutdown.
  - Ash can also harm local farms and infrastructure.

- **Climatic Effects of Eruptions**
  - Volcanic gas emissions can cause acid rain, harming ecosystems and infrastructure.
  - Sulphur aerosols from eruptions can lead to short-term global cooling.
  - Example: Mount Tambora’s eruption in 1815 caused global temperature drops, known as "the year without a summer."

- **Conclusion**
  - Understanding volcanic hazards is crucial for risk management and public safety.
