- **Module Overview: Volcanic Hazards**
  - Focus on volcanoes and later explore hazards and risks of eruptions.
  - Assessment of different types of magma and erupted materials.
  - Characteristics of magma influence eruption styles (peaceful vs. dangerous).

- **Definition of Volcanic Eruptions**
  - A volcano is an opening in Earth's crust for molten rock, rock fragments, and gases.
  - Various forms of volcanoes; classic conical shape is not universal.
  
- **Types of Volcanic Hazards**
  - Lava flows
  - Pyroclastic flows
  - Volcanic bombs
  - Ashfall
  - Hazards from non-erupting volcanoes (e.g., debris avalanches)

- **Magma and Lava**
  - **Magma**: Molten or partially molten rock beneath the Earth's surface; stored in a magma chamber.
  - **Lava**: Molten rock at the Earth's surface, either flowing or airborne.
  - Includes gases produced during eruptions.
  
- **Volatiles in Magma**
  - Compounds with low boiling points kept in solution due to overlying pressure.
  - Common volatiles: Water, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen sulfide.

- **Eruption Dynamics**
  - Magma rises as pressure decreases, causing volatiles to exsolve and form bubbles.
  - Explosive eruptions fragment magma into pyroclasts.
  - Eruption columns transport material into the atmosphere, potentially reaching altitudes of 50 km.

- **Igneous Rock Types and Composition**
  - Igneous rocks categorized by silica content:
    - **Mafic**: Low silica (e.g., basalt, gabbro); low viscosity.
    - **Felsic**: High silica (e.g., rhyolite, granite); high viscosity.
    - **Intermediate**: Between mafic and felsic (e.g., andesite, diorite).
   
- **Impact of Composition on Viscosity**
  - Viscosity influenced by temperature, crystal content, and silica content.
  - Mafic magmas flow easily; felsic magmas are sticky and flow slowly.

- **Differences in Tectonic Settings**
  - **Mid-Ocean Ridges**:
    - Diverging plates, forming mafic magma through decompression melting.
    - Pillow basalts formed underwater; minimal hazard to human life.
  
  - **Volcanic Arcs**:
    - Melting occurs from subducting plates carrying water-rich sediments, forming more explosive intermediate to felsic magmas.
  
  - **Hotspots**:
    - Eruptions vary based on whether oceanic or continental plates are melted.

- **Lava Forms and Properties**
  - **Pillow Basalts**: Formed underwater, characterized by glassy skin.
  - **Pumice**: Light, frothy volcanic glass, often floats on water.
  - **Cinders (Scoria)**: Dark, heavier pyroclasts, used in landscaping.
  - **Bombs and Blocks**: Large pyroclasts formed from basaltic eruptions; bombs are liquid during ejection.

- **Pyroclastic Materials**
  - **Ash**: Small particles that can be transported over large distances; dangerous.
  - **Pyroclastic Flows**: High-density flows of pyroclasts and gases; extremely deadly.

- **Volcanic Gases**
  - Dominated by water vapor; other gases include carbon dioxide, methane, and sulfur compounds.
  - Fumaroles release gases; sulfur deposits are indicative.

- **Benefits of Volcanic Soils**
  - Rich in nutrients from volcanic minerals.
  - Volcanic soils are some of the most fertile on Earth, balancing risks and benefits for human habitation.
