### Earth's Interior Structure
- **Concept of Rheology**: Study of how materials strain or deform under stress.
- **Earth's Mass Distribution**: 
  - Gravity is almost constant; mass uniformly distributed in concentric spherical shells.
  - Earth's average radius: 6,370 km.
- **Historical Measurements**:
  - Eratosthenes (240 BC): Determined Earth's size.
  - Skihalion experiment (1774): 
    - Estimated Earth's density (~5.5 g/cm³) by measuring pendulum deflection due to a nearby mountain.
    - Revealed density increases inward (surface rocks: 2-3 g/cm³).

### Earth's Crust
- **Observed Depth**: Up to a few km; crust is the outermost solid layer.
- **Composition**:
  - Dominated by silica-rich igneous rocks (granite, basalt).
  - Thickness: 
    - Oceans: 5-10 km.
    - Continents: 30-40 km.
- **Kola Superdeep Borehole**: 
  - Deepest artificial point (12,226 m), reached in 1989.
  - Stopped due to high temperatures (180 °C) and pressure.

### Mantle Composition
- **Xenoliths**: Volcanic lavas can bring up foreign rocks (e.g., peridotite).
- **Laboratory Experiments**:
  - Olivine (upper mantle) transforms under pressure (up to 5 g/cm³).

### Seismic Studies
- **Seismic Waves**:
  - P-waves: Compressional, travel through solids and liquids.
  - S-waves: Shear, do not travel through liquids (indicates molten outer core).
- **Boundary Identification**:
  - Core-mantle boundary: 2,900 km depth; significant density contrasts.

### Rheological Structure
- **Stress and Strain**:
  - Stress: Force per unit area (Newtons/m² or Pascals).
  - Strain: Change in shape/deformation (unitless).
  - Types of stress:
    - Tensional: Extension strain.
    - Compressional: Shortening strain.
    - Shear: Simple shear strain.
  
- **Rheology Types**:
  - Elastic solids: Recoverable deformation.
  - Brittle solids: Break upon exceeding elastic limit.
  - Plastic solids: Permanent deformation; may flow under stress (ductile deformation).

### Heat Transfer Mechanisms
- **Conduction**: Particles collide within solids; heats the handle of a metal pan.
- **Convection**: Movement of heated particles in liquids (water in a pan).
- **Radiation**: Transfer of heat via electromagnetic waves.

### Earth's Geothermal Gradient
- **Temperature vs Depth**:
  - Upper 100 km: Linear increase (~25 °C/km).
  - Below 100 km: Gradual cooling through convection.
- **Peridotite Melting**:
  - Solidus: ~1,200 °C at surface.
  - Liquidus: ~1,800 °C at surface.
  
### Rheological Layers
- **Lithosphere**: Rigid solid (up to 100 km) - brittle.
- **Asthenosphere**: Soft, ductile plastic (partial melting).
- **Mesosphere**: Stiff, plastic solid; no melting due to convection.

### Types of Crust
- **Oceanic Crust**:
  - Composition: Basalt (3.0 g/cm³ density).
  - Thickness: ~5-10 km.
  
- **Continental Crust**:
  - Composition: Granite and sedimentary rocks (2.8 g/cm³ density).
  - Thickness: ~30-40 km (thicker in mountain ranges).

### Space Hazards: Geomagnetic Storms
- **Magnetic Field Generation**: 
  - From convective flow of liquid iron in the outer core.
  - Extends into space (magnetosphere) and deflects solar wind.
  
- **Solar Wind**: Energetic stream of charged particles from the sun; causes auroras and can disturb Earth’s magnetic field.
  
- **Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs)**: 
  - Large releases of gas and magnetic field; can have severe effects on technology.
  
### Historical Example: Carrington Event (1859)
- **Impact**:
  - Disrupted telegraph systems; fires and auroras visible worldwide.
  
- **Modern Implications**:
  - Potential impacts of modern analog (e.g., 1989 Quebec blackout due to geomagnetic storm).
  - Estimated economic damage from a severe solar storm could reach $40 billion/day. 

### Summary
- Reviewed Earth's evolution, interior structure, and the effects of space hazards, emphasizing the importance of understanding both for studying geological and atmospheric phenomena.
