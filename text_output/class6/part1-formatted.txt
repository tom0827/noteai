- **Earthquake Magnitude vs. Intensity:**
  - Magnitude: physical size of the earthquake.
  - Intensity: strength of shaking caused by the earthquake.

- **Magnitude Scales Overview:**
  - First developed by Charles Richter in 1935.
    - Focused on regional comparisons in Southern California.
    - Used Wood-Anderson seismograph.
  - Magnitude determined from largest amplitude on a seismogram, corrected for distance.

- **Richter Scale:**
  - Example Calculation:
    - Seismogram shows P-wave and S-wave arrivals, S-P time: 24 seconds → Distance: 220 km, Peak amplitude: 23 mm → Magnitude: 5.0.
    - Amplitude at 100 km distance: 100 mm (Magnitude 5.0 = 100 mm at 100 km).
    - Smaller magnitudes (e.g., increment down to 4.0 = 2.3 mm) demonstrate logarithmic nature.
  - Limitations:
    - Difficult to apply globally.
    - Saturates around magnitude 6.

- **Local Magnitude Scales:**
  - Developed for specific regions (local use only for small earthquakes).
  - Superseded by moment magnitude scale for larger earthquakes.

- **Moment Magnitude Scale (Mw):**
  - Introduced in the 1970s.
  - Based on seismic moment: 
    - Seismic moment = rupture area × average slip × shear modulus.
  - Advantages of moment magnitude:
    - Does not saturate, accurate for large earthquakes.
    - Easy calculation from modern data sources.

- **Seismic Moment Explained:**
  - Units in Newton meters (Nm), relates to energy but is a torque measure.
  - A significant increase in moment reflects a large increase in earthquake energy:
    - 1 unit increase in moment magnitude = ≈ 31.6 times increase in seismic moment.

- **Earthquake Size Classification:**
  - Small: Magnitude 2-3
  - Moderate: Magnitude 4-5
  - Large: Magnitude 6-7
  - Great: Magnitude > 8

- **Rupture Area and Slip Relationship:**
  - Average slip correlates with rupture length.
    - Magnitude 6 → 10 km rupture, 30 cm slip.
    - Magnitude 7 → 60 km rupture, 1.5 m slip.
    
- **Key Faults and Earthquake Potential:**
  - Cascadia Subduction Megathrust (capable of magnitude 9) vs. San Andreas Fault (limited to magnitude 8).
  - The potential size of earthquakes governed by the fault rupture area.

- **Earthquake Statistics (Gutenberg-Richter Law):**
  - Each unit increase in magnitude → tenfold decrease in frequency.
  - Global averages:
    - ~10,000 mag 4 earthquakes/year.
    - ~1,000-2,000 mag 5 earthquakes/year.
    - ~100-200 mag 6 earthquakes/year.
    - ~10-20 mag 7 earthquakes/year.
    - 1-2 mag 8 earthquakes/year, 1-2 mag 9 in a decade.

- **Foreshocks, Mainshocks, and Aftershocks:**
  - Mainshock: largest earthquake in a sequence.
  - Aftershocks: smaller earthquakes following the mainshock.
  - Foreshocks: precede the mainshock, not always present.
  
- **Ridgecrest Sequence Analysis:**
  - Example: July 3-6, 2019.
    - Initial sequence with magnitude 3.5 (foreshocks), followed by magnitude 6.4 (mainshock), then magnitude 7.1.
  - Highlights the unpredictability of foreshocks and aftershocks and challenges in earthquake prediction. 

This structured format can assist in studying the distinctions and factors related to earthquake magnitude and intensity scales.
