- **Categories of Landslides**
  - **Material Types**
    - Rock
    - Mud
    - Debris (mixture of rock, soil, vegetation)
    - Earth and Soil

  - **Types of Movement**
    - **Falls**: Material falling through the air
    - **Slides**: Material sliding downhill
    - **Flows**: Mass of solid particles behaving like a fluid

- **Basic Types of Landslides**
  - Debris flows
  - Mud flows
  - Rock slides
  - Debris slides
  - Mud slides
  - Rock falls
  - Debris falls

- **Further Classifications**
  - **Speed of Movement**
    - Creep: imperceptible movement
    - Rock falls: several meters per second
    - Variable speeds (debris slides, mud flows)

  - **Water Content**
    - Water-saturated or dry

- **Specific Landslide Types**
  - **Rock Falls**
    - Free fall from cliffs, common in coastal areas
    - Example: Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore rock fall (2019)

  - **Rock Slides**
    - Slides along a basal failure surface
    - Typically have:
      - Headscarp
      - Back-tilted blocks
      - Toe-scarp at the bottom
    - Example: Major landslide in Peru

  - **Translational Rock Slides**
    - Planar failure surface, faster and further travel
    - Example: Alta, Norway (2020)

  - **Debris Slides**
    - Fragments mix with soil and vegetation
    - Example: Triggered by the 2018 Tomokomai earthquake in Japan

- **Flows**
  - **Types of Flows**
    - Earth flows: made of soil
    - Debris flows: fragmented rock, soil, vegetation
    - Mud flows: wet mud
    - Lahars: wet volcanic ash
  - **Characteristics**
    - Behave as viscous fluids
    - Can travel great distances
    - Example: Debris flows at Kedarnath (2013)

- **Soil Creep**
  - Slow, common landslide type
  - Caused by cyclic expansion and contraction of soil particles

- **Composite Landslides**
  - Transition between types (e.g., from rotational rock slide to debris slide to debris flow)
  - Example: New Zealand landslide (2017) triggered by Tropical Cyclone Debbie

- **Rock Avalanches**
  - Composite landslides from rock falls that disintegrate into debris slides
  - Example: Rock avalanche at Pis Sengalo (Swiss Alps, 2016)

- **Sterstroms**
  - Type of rock avalanche with long horizontal distance relative to vertical drop 
  - Example: Black Hawk slide in California
  - Theories explaining long runouts:
    - Acoustic fluidization
    - Pressurized air pockets

This overview encapsulates the key concepts related to landslide types and characteristics discussed in the lecture.
