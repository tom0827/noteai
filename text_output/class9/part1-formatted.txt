- **Introduction to Earthquake Risks**
  - Focus on earthquake risks and risk reduction
  - Risk = Hazard × Vulnerability
  - Importance of reducing vulnerability

- **Pillars of Emergency Management**
  - **Mitigation:** Preventing future hazards or reducing effects
  - **Preparedness:** Preparing to handle emergencies before they occur
  - **Response:** Safe reaction to emergencies
  - **Recovery:** Return to normal after emergencies

- **Global Trends in Earthquake Risks**
  - Increased fatalities in large earthquakes over the last centuries
  - Explanations for increased fatalities:
    - No evidence for increased earthquake frequency
    - Increased population and urbanization

- **Population and Earthquake Risk**
  - Graph showing global population growth and cumulative earthquake fatalities
  - Rise in the number of large cities and megacities
  - Hazardous regions: Alpine-Himalayan belt, high population density areas (China, India)

- **Seismic Hazard Factors**
  - Geographic areas prone to large earthquakes
  - Notable countries at risk: Iran, Turkey, China, India
  - Vulnerability × Hazard = Risk framework visualized through maps

- **Mitigation Strategies**
  - Primary focus on building design to withstand earthquakes
 
- **Building Material Considerations**
  - **Masonry buildings:** Rigid, brittle, susceptible to collapse
    - Example: Adobe structures in Bam, Iran (90% destruction in 2003 earthquake)
  - **Wood:** Flexible, lightweight, better performance in earthquakes
    - Example: Wood frame houses survived the 1906 San Francisco earthquake
  - **Steel:** Strong and flexible but expensive, used in large buildings

- **Building Design Factors**
  - Importance of proper anchoring to strong foundations
  - Risks of sliding off foundations
  - **Soft First Story Collapse:**
    - Multi-story buildings with large openings (e.g. garages) prone to collapse
    - Illustrations of soft story failures in various earthquakes

- **Engineering Solutions for Older Buildings**
  - Retrofitting older buildings to meet codes for seismic safety
  - Historical masonry buildings requiring expensive retrofits
  - Mandatory soft story retrofits in some regions (e.g., California)
   
- **Natural Resonance of Buildings**
  - Relation between building height and resonance frequency
  - Buildings sway at frequencies related to their height
  - Effects of seismic waves on buildings:
    - Example: Mexico City earthquakes (1985 vs. 2017)
  
- **Strategies to Mitigate Resonance Effects**
  - Use of shock absorbers to dampen vibrations
  - Base isolation techniques to protect buildings
    - Example: The Cube building in Vancouver with base isolation design
