- **Overview of Lecture Topics**
  - Formation of the Earth
  - Materials of the Earth and their behavior
  - Connection between Earth's evolution and structure
  - Space hazards related to Earth's position in the solar system

- **Formation of the Earth**
  - Earth formed from a rotating cloud of dust and gas from a supernova.
  - Coalescence took around 50 to 100 million years.
  - Examples of formation snapshots:
    - **Crab Nebula**: Young gas and dust cloud, formed from a supernova in 1054 AD.
    - **HL Tauri**: Proto-planetary disk, approximately one million years old.
  
- **Accretion Process**
  - Accretion: Particles accumulate into planetesimals, then proto-planets.
  - Collisions generated intense heat causing proto-Earth to melt and differentiate.
  - **Differentiation**: Separation of chemical constituents into distinct layers (core, mantle).
    - Core formed from molten iron; lighter materials formed the mantle.

- **Meteorites and Their Importance**
  - Meteorites as fragments of proto-planets and planetesimals.
  - Identification of meteorites easier in deserts and icy regions.
  
- **Classes of Meteorites**
  - **Stony Meteorites**:
    - 75-90% silica-based minerals, 10-25% nickel-iron alloy.
    - **Chondrites**: 86% of meteorites; represent primitive materials.
    - **Achondrites**: Lack chondrules; from differentiated bodies.
  
  - **Stony Iron Meteorites**:
    - Mixture of silicates and nickel-iron alloy; from boundary regions of planetesimals.

  - **Iron Meteorites**:
    - Primarily nickel-iron alloy; originated from cores of differentiated bodies.

- **Historical Scientific Estimates of Earthâ€™s Age**
  - **Lord Kelvin's Method**:
    - Estimated Earth's age at ~100 million years based on cooling from a molten state.
  
  - **John Perry's Revision**:
    - Considered convection in the mantle, yielding ages of 2-3 billion years.

  - **Discovery of Radioactivity (Henri Becquerel, 1896)**:
    - Radioactive decay contributes to Earth's internal heat.
    - Radiometric dating developed from decay series measurements.

- **Current Age of Earth**
  - First dated in 1956: 4.55 billion years using Canyon Diablo meteorite.
  - Solar system formed ~4.56 billion years ago; accretion and differentiation occurred in ~30 million years.
  
- **Geological Time Scale**
  - Established with reference to fossils.
  - Representation of animal existence indicates humans as a recent presence in Earth's history.

- **Natural Radioactivity as a Hazard**
  - Naturally occurring radioactivity affecting exposure levels.
  - High radiation areas (e.g., Cornwall) correlate with geology.

- **Impact Events and Space Hazards**
  - Definition: Collisions between Earth and extraterrestrial objects (asteroids, comets).
  - Most asteroids are found in the asteroid belt and Kuiper belt.

- **Characteristics of Asteroids and Comets**
  - Asteroids: Range from hundreds of meters to kilometers; largest objects in asteroid belt.
  - Comets: Contain ice; tails formed when near the sun.
  
- **Frequency of Impact Events**
  - Small cosmic dust constantly entering atmosphere.
  - Larger impacts (>100 meters) every ~10,000 years.
  - Catastrophic events (1 kilometer or larger) every 500,000 years.

- **Significant Impact Events**
  - **Manicougan Crater**: Formed 214 million years ago by a 5 km meteorite.
  - **Sudbury Crater**: Formed 1.85 billion years ago by a 10-15 km impactor.
  
- **Historical Incidents:**
  - **Tunguska Event (1908)**: Airburst explosion with significant energy release, no fatalities.
  - **Chelyabinsk Meteor (2013)**: Exploded over Russia, significant shockwave, undetected prior.

- **Mass Extinction Events**
  - Related to asteroid impacts; notable events during the Devonian and Cretaceous periods.
  - Evidence connects extinction events to climatic changes and impacts, with distinct geological markers.

- **Asteroid Impact Avoidance**
  - Proposed methods to divert near-Earth objects on collision courses with Earth identified in recent decades.
